Scenario: develop a banking application

Requirement Analysis: The client wants 5 following functionalities
-User Acceptance testing 
1) Login on Valid Credientials
2) View Current Balance
3) Deposit
4) Withdraw
5) Transfer

Functional Specification:
-system testing
Architecture, database, and environment design are finalized

High Level Design Stage:
-integration testing
The applcation is broken down into module and programs
              Login
                |
                V
          Current Balance
       |         |           |
       v         v           v   
   Deposit    Withdraw     Transfer
   
Detail Design:
-unit testing
The pseudocode for each module is documented

Next: coding occurs

Unit Testing:
-It is also called component testing.
-It is performed on standalone module to check whether it is developed correctly
Example: using login on Valid Credientials
unit tests for this example would be: checking for a valid login and password, checking for an invalid login and password,
checking response when login is empty and pressed

Unit testing is done by developers and testers
