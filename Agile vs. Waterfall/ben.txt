Incubate (waterfall) vs iterate (agile)

Waterfall:
Think about what you want to do long and hard then devlop it
Iterative: Minimum viable project 
Break up what youre trying to do into a simple version and put it out there

Waterfall methodology:
- the traditional and time proven approach
- allows the execuation of large and complex projects
- a linear appraoch from start to beginning
- througough planning and documentation
- 6 stages: idea, analysis, design, developement, test, final product
-The design document is used as a blueprint for development
-don't go back to previous stages
-if you want a product with great accuracy
-waterfall is somewhat outdated

Agile values
-Individulas and interacrtions over processes and tools
-working software over comprhensive documentatin
-customer collaboration over contract negotion
-responding to change over following a plan

The hope with agile is to build a framework that can adjust to changing demands,
learn from mistakes, ensure a tighter feedback group, resulting in a faster product that's
more durable.

Defining features of agile
-sprints: a chunk of time when people work on code that are usually a couple weeks
-Requirements are tracked
-priorites are tracked for the next sprint
-retrospective is where people say what is good and bad
-a scrum master is in charge of sprints, they don't necessarily have a technical background
-stand ups are usually daily where people stand up and hear what others are working on


Is agile better?
Not necessarily,
Agile is where products need small and frequent updates
waterfall is when you prefer quality over speed
Example to use waterfall: a banking app that holds personal data, to make sure nothing goes wrong
Example to use agile: a social media app since the competition is fierce and people adapt to changes
